const  accountID = 5945

// this is also possible but we not prefer to use this also

var accountEmail = "razaqueg007@gmail.com"
// var  is not used now a days because it is deprecated we use let nowadays
// prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope

// accountID = 34 not allowed to change the value of const

console.table([accountID,accountName])
// we can print the different variable in table format by using console.table([variableNames])
